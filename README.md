### CHALLENGES & OTHER COMMENTS
#### The most difficult part of this project was cleaning the data. We knew exactly what steps we neded to take being: 1) removing variables that seemed unimportant/less impactful to the predictive model, 2) deleting null values in the columns (aka X variables), 3) encoding variables that we were told were categorical, and 4) running a correlation matrix to further narrow down the variables to use for the model. (Note: After dropping the null values, it turned out that none of the categorical variables were left so we did not have to encode them.) However, my partner's computer could not run a file this large, and my computer struggled as well so we settled on using a sample size of 20,000 rows for the predictive model. Of course, this isn't the model ideal because the actual datset had 5.5 million rows and we only do
